 * Much better support for fetching very large sequences from BLAST
   databases, or portions thereof.  get_sequence() method on a
   Bio::BLAST::Database returns a new lazy-loading sequence object.
   subseq() fetch only the requested sequence region, and calls which
   require the full sequence (e.g. seq() and length() ) are handled by
   an encapsulated Bio::Seq::LargePrimarySeq object. All of this
   drastically improves speed and reduces memory usage when using very
   large sequences.
